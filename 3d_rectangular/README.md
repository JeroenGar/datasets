- **MISSING DATASETS**
    - 3D Container loading problem (THPACK9 IMM) from IVANCIC/MATHUR/MOHANTY (1989) This data was originally used in Ivancic (1989) and then in Bischoff (1995).

    - 3D Container loading problem (THPACK8 LN) from LOH/NEE (1992) This data was originally used in Loh (1992) and then in Ngoi (1994) and then in Bischoff (1995).

    - 3D Container loading problems (THPACK1-7 BR) from BISCHOFF/RATCLIFF (1995) These files were generated and used in Bischoff (1995). The procedure used to create these test problems is presented in the paper.

    - 3D Boxes on shelves test problems (BAYTP) from HOARE/BEASLEY (2001) These data files are the test problems used in the paper Hoare (2001).
